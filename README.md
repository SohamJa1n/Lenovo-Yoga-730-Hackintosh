THIS SERVES ONLY AS A REFERENCE FOR YOUR USE IF YOU HAVE ANY ISSUES. YOU SHOULD BY NO MEANS USE THIS EFI FOR YOUR DEVICE. ONLY USE IT FOR DOUBLE CHECKING EVERYTHING IS CORRECT. I WILL NOT GIVE SUPPORT IF YOU USE THIS EFI NOR WILL R/HACKINTOSH OR THE R/HACKINTOSH DISCORD SERVER. HOWEVER IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS EFI, THEN I WILL BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM. JUST SIMPLY MAKE AN ISSUE AND I WILL LOOK AT IT. IT IS LIKELY GOING TO BE OUTDATED.

This EFI is for the Lenovo Yoga 730-13IWL. Most of the things work but I will list the things that don't work.

RAM: 8gb 2400mhz

SSD: WD Blue SN750 1TB

Audio: Realtek ALC255

Things that don't work:

The fingerprint sensor

Thunderbolt hot-plug

Touchscreen(As expected, but it just acts as a massive touchpad)
