# Lenovo-Yoga-730-Hackintosh


This EFI is for the Lenovo Yoga 730-13IWL. Most of the things work but I will list the things that don't work.

Specs:

CPU: Intel Core i5-8265u

GPU: Intel UHD 620

RAM: 8gb 2400mhz

SSD: WD Blue SN750 1TB

Audio: Realtek ALC255

Extra Features: Touchscreen, I2C touchpad, Goodix Fingerprint scanner, Thunderbolt USB-C, Integrated camera

Things that don't work:

The fingerprint sensor

Thunderbolt hot-plug

Touchscreen(As expected, but it just acts as a massive touchpad)
